# GitHomework-03-Password
User Guide:

When the webpage is refreshed, the user will be prompted to choose their criteria to generate a password.

The console log will record all the inputs of the user.

After the alerts, user can press the "Generate Password" button to generate as many random passwords as he/she wants.



Some functions I have used:

To force the user to input a password length between 8 and 128, I used "while" function to loop until the user inputs a valid number.

To force the user to choose at least one of the character options to inclue, I also used "while" function to loop until the user clicks at least one "ok".

After the user has selected all criteria, the pool of password characters will be console.logged.
