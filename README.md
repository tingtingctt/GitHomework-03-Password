# GitHomework-03-Password
User Guide:

When the webpage is refreshed, the user will be prompted to choose their criteria to generate a password.

The console log will record all the info about the user's input.

After the alerts, user can press the "Generate Password" button to generate as many random passwords as he/she wants.



Some functions I have used:

To make the user input ONLY an integral numeric value between 8 and 128 (no fractions or letters), I used "while" function to loop until the user inputs a valid integral number.

To make the user choose at least one of the character types to include, I also used "while" function to loop until the user clicks at least one "ok".

After the user has selected all criteria, the pool of password characters will be console.logged.
